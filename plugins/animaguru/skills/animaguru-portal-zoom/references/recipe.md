# Portal Zoom production recipe

The workspace includes an executable original study in `src/studies/scenes.ts`, selected with `portal-zoom`. Its drawing commands are consumed by `src/studies/pixi-renderer.ts`; geometry and time sampling are shared with the gallery renderer. All copy lives in `shared/locales/en/style-studies.json`.

In an untouched starter, run `npm run example -- portal-zoom`, then `npm run dev`. The command refuses to replace an authored film, retains starter backups in `production/example-backup/`, and writes an 8-second study with its own resource tracks. `npm run export:mp4` uses this installed film normally. To use the recipe inside an existing film, import `studyFrame()` and `StudyRenderer`, then compose the selected scene into the project's timeline instead of running the installer.

## Adaptation decisions

- Prepare the next world inside the portal and match camera/framing when the aperture fills the frame. Backgrounds need overscan and filled hidden regions.
- Logarithmic scale progression can produce even perceived zoom speed. Segment timing comes from the film, not a fixed object list or song structure.
- Bound zoom by texture resolution and compute nested scenes from time. At a loop, match both composition and motion direction; a matching still alone does not prove a seamless loop.

The study is silent, original procedural art. Photographic studies use illustrated media cards and product studies use an illustrative object; replace these with actual supplied/generated assets for production. It demonstrates material, transforms and layout rather than proving real product claims. Configure an original subject, palette, scene sequence, duration and soundtrack from the brief.

Use `src/studies/timing.ts` for deterministic easing, seeded variation, measured stroke truncation and cue helpers. `window.animaguru.texts` exposes visible study text bounds for `npm run review`; text declarations alone do not count as visual proof. Inspect the actual frames as well.

## Sources and attribution

Inspired by the following pinned references; source-specific 3D/media dependencies are not bundled. New study art and scene geometry are original. The workspace's `VIDEO-STYLE-NOTICES.txt` preserves the repository notices and clarifies third-party asset scope.
